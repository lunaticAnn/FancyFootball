You can use the "prediction" scene to add events; <br>
Ratio is randomly generated and normalized; <br>
The "betting" scene will automatically convert it to timed votes;<br>
I am working on developer scene so you guys can parse time point and events more easily;

TODO list:
- offense/defense is half-done;
- progression bar
- UI upgrade
- delete an existing record 
- break point function[conbine with server]:<br>
  user can join game at any time point; <br>
  this should deal with the issue when user switch team in between;<br>
  they are able to continue as the other team;<br>
